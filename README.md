# Project Overview
# Predict Hospital Readmission Risk for Patients with Chronic Conditions
# Hospital readmissions among patients with chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension are a major healthcare concern. Early prediction of readmission risk can help reduce unnecessary hospital stays and improve patient outcomes. This project aims to build a machine learning model to identify high-risk patients based on their medical and demographic data.
